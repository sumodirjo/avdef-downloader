Antivirus Definition Update Downloader
=====================================

Overview
--------
This script used to download antivirus definition update for several antivirus product. This only help download the definition update and not applying the update to each devices.

History
-------
Actually this is a complete rewrite of a script that I wrote around 2005 when I was still in college. I was a Lab assistant on departement computer labs. I saw students downloading the same antivirus definition update several times. 

At that time we only have 256kbps internet connection. So I created this script so students (and lecturers) can download the definition update from local server instead of downloading directly from internet. We save bandwidth in office hour and the bandwidth is used on the night :)

You can use this script to help your customer downloading antivirus so you can help them have a secure computer while you also save bandwidth :)
